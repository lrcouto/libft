# libft
This is my C function library, created as my first project as a cadet at École 42 - São Paulo. It includes functions to manipulate memory, strings and linked lists, and is being constantly expanded and modiified in it's structure and content.

This version of libft has been modified several times and it's ***not*** in the project structure expected by Moulinette. It is compliant with Norminette version 3.3.2.

## Usage

Clone the repository. Compile with `make`. Compile the resulting `libft.a` binary with your project.

## Function list
